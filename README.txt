# Welcome to Bouncing Ball project

# Contents of the project include

* p5.min.js file
* image folder
* index.html
* sketch.js


## p5.min.js

This file is a minified version of the p5.js file. It is a lighter version, with the same functionalities, but smaller file size. This minified version is harder to read for humans, and does not include the friendly error system.


### index.html

index.html is a template for an HTML file. This index.html first imports the libraries included in the folder (p5.js) then loads and executes the file sketch.js which is where you can write your own code.

### sketch.js

The sketch.js is a template for the p5.js sketch, with the functions setup() and draw() that you can complete.
